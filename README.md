  ## Main problems faced when working on the project 
 
  The biggest problems I faced were tiny bugs that took me forever finding. These consisted of mis-spellings to incorrect file names being called. I also had a tough time setting up the correct way to set cache logic up.  

  ## Main take aways from the project 

  I learned how to set up a custom webpack file and how to store things in the cache of a website.
